# car-select
A car selection webpage that updates the total cost based on the options you select.

If you're seeing this, hi! This was my first public project on GitHub, and honestly
it kinda sucks.

Sometimes I come back here when I'm feeling nostalgic, because it reminds me what's
possible. I have come so far in the three years since I made this, going from a
basic HTML form to designing full-stack applications. I regularly work in JavaScript,
PHP, Python, NodeJS, and SQL now, and I'm trying to learn more every day.

It motivates me to keep pushing myself, to keep moving forwards, to see what I can 
become in another three years. If you're reading this, just know that the sky is
the limit, and that when you look back at your progress in a year's time you will
be blown away.
